This is a readme about flexbox.
Flexblox is a way to arrange items into rows and columns.
This items will flex (that's grow and shrink) based on some simple rules that you can define.
anything that has a display flex on it is a flexbox
a flexitem is anything that lives inside a flex container.

## The flex shorthand
The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can  set on flex item.these properties affects how flex ow items size themselves within the container
 flex has flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis
 flex: 0; - flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0;
#### flex-grow
flex-item's 'growth factor'
flex: 1 is applied to every div hence all the divs would grow equally
